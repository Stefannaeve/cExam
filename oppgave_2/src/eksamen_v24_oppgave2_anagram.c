/* This function takes two pointers to words (char pointers) as arguments and returns true if the words are anagrams, and false if they are not.

 The function initializes two arrays, count1 and count2, to count the occurrences of each letter in the respective words. It then iterates through 
 each character in both words and increments the corresponding count in the respective arrays, ignoring non-alphabetic characters using the isalpha function.

 After counting the occurrences of each letter in both words, the function compares the count of each letter between the two arrays. If any count differs, 
 the function immediately returns false, indicating that the words are not anagrams. If all counts are equal, the function returns true, indicating that the words are anagrams. */
